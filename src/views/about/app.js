        I'm a french software developper interested in photography who just decided to combine these two domains and make
        <a href="/">t.hottou.fr</a> to share my work and progression.
        Every time you come on this website everything may have changed because, well that's what i get for making my own website,
        i'm never fully statisfied by its design! So i invite you to come here from time to time to appreciate my work and the time
        i put into making these shots and this website.
